Description:
This project is based off of tamagatchi gmes, except we had the primary character be Professor Taylor's axolotl
The goal of the game is to move kimchee around by clicking on the aquarium, and keeping up her hunger and happiness bars.
Hunger can be gained by feeding kimchee snails, worms, and 112 homework. However feeding her 112 homework makes her sad :(
Happiness is gained by playing with kimchee and moving around the aquarium

Coins can be obtained when kimchee swims to them, before they despawn. 
Coins can be redeemed in the market to buy more food for kimchee, or to buy decorations for the aquarium

Please note, all the sprites in this game were hand drawn by us over the 24 hours.

To run code:
Ensure modules are all installed
Run the file:" tamokimchee.py"
